# Aim: To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation

# Algorithm:
1. Identify the Goal

    Decide whether the audio to be generated is music, narration, or sound effects.

2. Design the Prompt

    Use descriptive prompts including mood, style, instruments, genre, or voice tone.

Example: “Generate calm background music with soft piano and ambient strings for relaxation.”

3. Experiment with Prompting Techniques

    Zero-shot prompting: Directly asking the model without examples.

    Few-shot prompting: Providing short examples of desired outputs.

    Instruction-based prompting: Using explicit instructions like tempo, pitch, rhythm, voice type.

    Refinement prompting: Iteratively modifying prompts to improve results.

4. Generate Audio

    Use an AI audio generation tool/model (e.g., text-to-music, text-to-speech).

5. Evaluate Output

    Check if the generated audio matches the style and requirements of the prompt.

6. Refine Prompt if Needed

    Adjust words, add constraints (e.g., “fast-paced,” “female narrator”), or simplify until output is satisfactory.
